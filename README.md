##Agile software processes for other things

Software is written with words. The languages used are rather specific so that their meaning can be exact and unambiguous, but they are not that far removed from any other language. The fact that software must be exact, that not a single word can be out of place, makes it very hard for programmers to work together on the same document. One small comma out of place and it all falls down. Yet, how come the same piece of software could have thousands of contributors? More than that, thousands of people working on the same text - and no central plan or project management?

## A course in agile proceses
Agile at Home is a series of workshops designed to share some of the techniques developed to run software projects 


# History of programming and open source
Many of the techniques developed to manage software projects can be applied to real world environments. The combination of art and engineering that is required to build large software projects necessitated a whole new way of working. The massively collaborative, decentralised techniques that evolved to build open source projects involving thousands of developers and no managers required the creeation of completely new toolsets, but those tools can now be used for many purposes, including those not erlated to computer software. Before learning the processes born in software engineering, it is worth getting an understanding of where and why they evolved. 

# Impact Mapping
One of the simplest and most immediately applicable methodologies used in agile software is the impact map. It distills a number of different techniques into a clear and understandable mind-mapping process. Impact mapping is a technique used to get all project stakeholders to bring their needs and objectives together, in a simple and visual way. It introduces the ideas of measurement, personas, user stories and MVP - simply and without the need for lengthy discussion. 

# Personas and user centered design
Building on the initial impact mapping process, we dig into the idea of grouping together the various project stakeholders into personas. Personas allow us to teach people to frame their projects and objectives in terms of real world people and outcomes. Any project can benefit from having a way to describe the different interest groups, factions or "tribes" that may be involved and indentifiying their needs. Doing so enables user centered design to take place, in which projects are defined in terms of what people need to get out, rather than what goes in. This can be applied in many different spheres, and provides one of the key foundations of destribiuted management. 

# Lean 
Although lean methodologies did not originate in software development, they have been dramatically enhanced and publicised due to their adoption by the software start-up community. The key ideas behind the lean methodologies encourage people to approach their objectives by clearly defining their assumptions about what might work, and then finding the simplest way to test those assumptions - the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Lean is an approach that encourages fast failure and rapid learning. The lean approach allows projects to grow with the smallest possible investment, and the best long term term odds for success. Lean techniques attempt to make success more of a science than an art. 

# User stories and acceptance criteria
One of the most popular tools of the agile software trade is the "User Story". User stories encourage project objectives to be defined in terms of the key requirements of a it's users. 

One of the key elements to user stories is that they decentralise the decision making process. The stories do not prescribe how something should be done, instead they are extended to define their acceptance criteria - a definition of what success looks like. It is then up to the individual responsible for implementing the story to actually work out the details. 

#Test first and metrics
Understanding what success looks like is made even more powerful when it is possible to associate metrics and some kind of test with the end result. Forcing someone to think about how they would test whether or not their work is effective is a very valuable process and can be applied in all sorts of situations.

# Scrum, Kanban and sprints - the iterative development process
With a combined understanding of personas, MVP, and stories, we can move on to applying these methods to real day to day operations. The use of story cards on a wall and daily stand-up meetings (both core elements of the kanban and scrum process) can be used for rapidly communicating and tracking project progress, whilst assigning points to user stories based on their size and complexity and prioritising them in order of importance allows for decentralized management. These techniques are used iteratively throughout the lifetime of the project. 

ALl these processes can function effectively without the need for any technology or fixed managers. Scrum and Kanban require multidisciplanry teams without heirarchy to work best andy empower individual members of a team to work in their own style, while also requiring the establishment of common practices and standards.

# Roadmaps
Software always has so many possible outcomes, anything is possible. Most software projects could be extended forever, with all sorts of distractions along the way. Most real world projects are the same. In order to involve many people in creating a defined long range vision for a project, roadmaps are used to gather and share the possible routes it can take and any external factors which may effect the project over time. 

Roadmapping is a very useful process for any organisation. It is inclusive, but allows for focus and prioritsation of tasks by placing options within a bigger context. Roadmaps build on user stories, but extend them to look further into the future. 

# Version control
Perhaps the most influential tool to come out of software development is concurrent, distributed version control. Version control tools allow thousands of developers to work effectively on the source code for a single project. 

For an organisation to grow beyond it's founders, and operate in a decentralised way, it's processes and operational rules need to be written down (this is the essence of the franchise process). Once written down, these texts are the organisation's source code. They are the programme that the organisation runs - and the best tool for managing this "software" is version control. 

When key documents are managed in a version control system, indivuduals within a project are empowered to independently suggest changes - without the need for someone else to first grant them permission to speak - an issue that often effects collabrative discussion. The processes of branching and merging are very powerful organisational tools, if matched with a basic process that allows changes to be voted in.

When "organisational source code" is stored in an online tool like github.com, it becomes possible for other organisations to 'fork' this founding architecture, and build new organisations based upon it - a concept fundamental to the idea of open source. 

Version control is one of those processes that is really only made possible by specific tools. The tools have evolved from very technical origins, but new online sites like github provide an accessible way to apply them. 

# Process mapping
Although version control is a very effective tool for managing operational processes, the method by which these processes are captured is an altogether different one that goes far beyond software engineering - but programming techniques can help here too. 

Applying the user story mapping process, and lean techniques, it is possible to map known organisational processes and to identify the next steps. We are able to bring together all a number of different techniques, and show how the various elements of an organisation can be documented in a manner that would allow significantly increased levels of individual empowerment and decentralisation.
